                    <strong>About</strong>
                    <p> My name is Evan Carter and I am a Software Engineering student at Florida Gulf Coast University. I've spent the majority of my life living in Cape Coral, Florida. Computer programming and - to a lesser extent - graphic design have been interests of mine since the start of highschool, when I first began taking classes in them.

                        <br> <br>
                        I now have several years of educational experience in both programming and design and continue to self teach and work on projects with other students.
                        This experience has left me proficient in C#, HTML, and Java, as well as the IDEs Microsoft Visual Studio and Unity.
                    
                        <br> <br>
                        I find engineering alluring for its emphasis on detailed, critical thought and deep understanding of the subject matter. In recent years, I have also acquired a taste for pyshcology and am considering pursuing a master's in it. 
                        As such, human systems engineering has become much more interesting and relevant to me as a possible career. 
                        Besides that however, I am also interested in data engineering and creative directing. I have found backend coding to be most enjoyable so I imagine I would be quite at home as a data engineer. 
                        My interest in creative directing comes from my extra-curricular writing and hosting of tabletop games in which I get to help others unleash their creativity.
