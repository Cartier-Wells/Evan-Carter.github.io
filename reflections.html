                    <p>
                        The purpose of the Current Efforts assignment was to identify and analyse current research and development projects associated with the themes of the NAE's vision for engineering in the 21st century. 
                        Taking up the theme of sustainability, the projects I identified are UrbanA and the Smog Free Project. UrbanA provides exceptionally valuable insight into the realm of research, as it shows the reality that
                        while a great quantity of knowledge and experience can be obtained through research, it is not always immediately usable. In understanding the goals of the Smog Free Project, I had to ask myself how dangerous 
                        air pollution really was, and the data is staggering. My impressions of both of these projects has left me with great respect for those involved.

                    <h3>Reflections on Challenges in Engineering</h3> <br> <br>

                    The course as a whole <br>


                    Sustainability Module <br>
                    As I have seen in classes prior, one of the biggest takeaways about sustainability is that it is not just about the environment but concerns social and economic issues as well. 
                    The intersection of these issues can be complex to understand, as could be seen in the climate policy discussion. Having to justify policy mechanisms even for a simple assignment was difficult, 
                    which gives me respect for the people who actually carry it out. The Play Pumps segment was particularly eye-opening and disappointing since it failed rather spectacularly despite the best of intentions. 
                    I think it ties somewhat into the policymaking considerations, as much of the issue with the Play Pumps boiled down to corporate and bureaucratic hang-ups. 
                    <br> <br>
                    Health Module <br>
                    The health moduleâ€™s core segment, the debate over bionics, had some interesting takeaways that may or may not have been intentional. The absolute majority of arguments made, whether for or against the technology, 
                    were based on specific data rather than lending credence to philosophy or ideology. I think these are, in reality, very important factors to consider when discussing the technology because some people simply will 
                    not be swayed by data alone if they believe it to be morally wrong. I chose to be on the side against bionics particularly because I already knew the benefits of the technology, so I wanted to see what people had 
                    to say against it and, as it turns out, there are several realities to the technology that hurt its support. 
                    <br> <br>
                    Security Module <br>
                    The greatest takeaway from the security module for me is the importance of understanding the scale of systems. The focus on identifying the parties involved in various situations helps to put into perspective the 
                    sheer scope of the interconnected web around engineered systems. This plays partially into what is probably a minor takeaway from the role play assignment: engineers can have major responsibility for systems that impact thousands, 
                    if not millions, of people. For me, that shows that good communication and proactivity are some of the most important skills to have.
