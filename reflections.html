                    <br>
                    The purpose of the Current Efforts assignment was to identify and analyse current research and development projects associated with the themes of the NAE's vision for engineering in the 21st century. 
                    Taking up the theme of sustainability, the projects I identified are UrbanA and the Smog Free Project. UrbanA provides exceptionally valuable insight into the realm of research, as it shows the reality that
                    while a great quantity of knowledge and experience can be obtained through research, it is not always immediately usable. In understanding the goals of the Smog Free Project, I had to ask myself how dangerous 
                    air pollution really was, and the data is staggering. My impressions of both of these projects has left me with great respect for those involved.

                    Reflections on Challenges in Engineering modules <br> <br>

                    Sustainability Module <br>
                    As I have seen in classes prior, one of the biggest takeaways about sustainability is that it is not just about the environment but concerns social and economic issues as well. 
                    The intersection of these issues can be complex to understand, as could be seen in the climate policy discussion. Having to justify policy mechanisms even for a simple assignment was difficult, 
                    which gives me respect for the people who actually carry it out. The Play Pumps segment was particularly eye-opening and disappointing since it failed rather spectacularly despite the best of intentions. 
                    I think it ties somewhat into the policymaking considerations, as much of the issue with the Play Pumps boiled down to corporate and bureaucratic hang-ups.
